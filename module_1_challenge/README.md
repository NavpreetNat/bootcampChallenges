## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The company's aim is to provide a platform for traders of NFTs to trade and store their blockchain derived products on the OpenSea marketplace. OpenSea also provides the facility to 'mint' NFTs. The minting process uses smart contracts on the blockchain network to validate a customer's NFT, proving them with a unique cryptographic serial number which they may use to authenticate their digital product.

The company thereby provides customers with a centralised hub where they may exchange, discover and develop NFTs. This in turn helps grow the space and encourage future investment in the sector. A key indicator of their importance has been their rapid growth from their inception only 5 years ago, to recently being valued at $13.3B USD as of January 2022.

OpenSea intially only used ethereum as a transaction method on the marketplace, however this was soon joined by a few other cryptocurrencies, including Solana, USD Coin and Dai.
