# Case Study of a Leader in the NFT Marketplace Domain

## Overview and Origin

### Company

OpenSea was founded in 2017<sup>[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSea)]</sup> by Devin Finzer (CEO) and Alex Atalla (CTO)<sup>[[2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/06/07/the-future-of-crypto-and-blockchain-fintech-50-2022/?sh=6d905f5360cc)]</sup>. The founders realised the growing potential of the NFT space and blockchain leveraged technologies, and set towards developing a marketplace where NFT (non-fungible token) products may be traded. By December of 2017, they had launched such a marketplace<sup>[[3](https://history-computer.com/opensea-history/#:~:text=After%20recognizing%20the%20potential%20future,in%202017%20and%20officially%20launched)]</sup>. According the their company website, the founders "were inspired by early NFT projects, like Cryptokitties, ... (and) envisioned how this (blockchain) technology's open protocols could enable devlopers and users to create open economies across games, platforms and digital worlds"<sup>[[4](https://opensea.io/learn/who-is-opensea)].


Devin especially, one of the companies founders, was more so interested in the 'tech thesis around crypto' and was interested into diving into what is it about blockchain technology that disrupts the landscape of the digital world, rather than simply looking only into financial technology, which is what much of silicon valley was interested in at the time<sup>[[5](https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-nft-platform-opensea-plans-to-maintain-its-competitive-advantage-ep-232/)]</sup>. The blockchain network allows for users to trasfer their NFTs products between machines all over the world in a seamless fashion with secure authentication and and ownership confirmation all along the way. As the technology is rooted in smart contracts and the ownership information is stored on the blockchain, owners of NFTs are protected when managing their products online.

The founders of OpenSea recognised a growing market demand in this area, and established the marketplace to take advantage of this new technology. Not only that, they were not long after able to mint NFTs on the website. The minting process uses smart contracts on the blockchain network to transform a customer's digital asset into an NFT, providing the user with a unique cryptographic serial number which they may use to authenticate their digital product and distribute it online<sup>[[4](https://opensea.io/learn)]

### Company Funding

As of September 2022, OpenSea has raised $427.2M in funding over several funding rounds<sup>[[6](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/opensea/investor_financials)]</sup>:

| Date        |Funding Round  | Amount      |
|    :----:   |     :----:    |   :----:    |
| Jan 5, 2022 | Series C      | $300M       |
| Jul 20, 2021| Series B      | $100M       |
| Mar 18, 2021| Series A      | $23M        |
| Nov 19, 2019| Seed Round    | $2.1M       |
| May 10, 2018| Seed Round    | $2M         |
|Jan 4, 2018  | Pre Seed Round| $120K       |

Apart from just funding, in 2021 OpenSea was responsible for $3B (USD) worth of monthly transactions of NFTs, with a revenue stream between $850 - $900M (USD) annualy<sup>[[2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/06/07/the-future-of-crypto-and-blockchain-fintech-50-2022/?sh=6d905f5360cc)]</sup><sup>[[7](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/making-sense-of-opensea-at-a-13b-valuation/)]

## Business Activities

The company's aim is to provide a platform for traders of NFTs to trade and store their blockchain derived products on the OpenSea marketplace. OpenSea also provides customers with the faculty to mint NFTs on the website itself and set a price for which they'd be willing to exchange their product(s) for cryptocurrency, typically ethereum. They are especially helpful towards digital artists who have now found a robust way of exchanging their artworks online at highly competitive prices. A notable example is the digital artist Beeple who made headlines in 2021 when his artwork 'Everydays: The First 5000 Days' sold for $69M (USD)<sup>[[8](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million)]</sup>.

Appreciators of art are likewise benefiting from the advent of NFT technology as OpenSea provides them with an avenue to trade this modern and emerging field of art. The company thereby provides customers with a centralised hub where they may exchange, discover and develop NFTs. This in turn helps grow the space and encourage future investment in the sector by attracting both established players and newcomers in the NFT space to the domain. A key indicator of their importance has been their rapid growth from their inception only 5 years ago, to recently being valued at $13.3B USD as of January 2022<sup>[[7](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/making-sense-of-opensea-at-a-13b-valuation/)]</sup>.

OpenSea intially only used ethereum as a transaction method on the marketplace, however this was soon joined by a few other cryptocurrencies, including Solana, USD Coin and Dai<sup>[[9](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500003082521-What-currencies-can-I-use-on-OpenSea-#:~:text=The%20core%20currencies%20on%20OpenSea,like%20USD%20or%20the%20Euro)]</sup>. Therefore, at its inception, the company met a gap in the NFT market which itself was in its stage of conception, solving the problem of artists and customers not having an established marketplace to exchange their NFTs.

### Intended Customer

OpenSea has been established to assist artists and traders of art alike, however it is not only art that falls under the NFT umbrella. The compnay also stocks the following digital assets<sup>[[10](https://opensea.io/)]

* Collectibles
* Domain Names
* Music
* Photography
* Sports
* Trading Cards
* Utility
* Virtual World

The intended customer is therefore any such person who is intersted in minting or trading any digital asset in the aforementioned list.

### Market Size

In terms of market size, the NFT market was recently valued last year (2021) at $15.7B (USD). Projections regarding market growth with respect to the calculated compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, vary with one source expecting the market to grow by $147.24B (USD) by 2026, and another predicting that the markat value with reach $122.43B (USD) by 2028.<sup>[[11](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/non-fungible-token-nft-market-research-report-by-technavio-predicts-usd-147-24-bn-growth-301588382.html)]</sup><sup>[[12](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/05/26/2451426/0/en/The-Global-Non-Fungible-Tokens-NFTs-Market-is-expected-to-reach-a-value-of-USD-122-43-Billion-by-2028-at-a-CAGR-of-34-10-over-the-forecast-period-2022-2028-SkyQuest-Technology.html)]

Needlesss to say, the market sentiment is that the domain is one of rapid growth, and the world is as yet in the early stages of the NFT, and more broadly the blockchain, revolution. OpenSea themselves expect 'that one day, nearly everything we own will be accounted for on a blockchain'<sup>[[4](https://opensea.io/learn/who-is-opensea)]</sup>.


### Advantage over Competitors

OpenSea sets to establish itself as a one-stop-shop for NFT transactions, which is what they are currently successful in maintaining. The company was able to enter the space of NFT marketplaces early, and were thereby able to beat other potential market players to the punch. There are now however several other players in the NFT-marketplace market, inlcuding but not limited to:<sup>[[13](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/nft-marketplaces/)]</sup><sup>[[14](https://blog.portion.io/the-history-of-nfts-how-they-got-started/)]</sup><sup>[[15](https://www.singlegrain.com/web3/opensea-alternatives/)]

* Axie Marketplace
* Larva Labs/CryptoPunks
* NBA Top Shot Marketplace
* Rarible
* SuperRare
* Foundation
* Nifty Gateway
* Mintable
* Theta Drop

In terms of capitalising on the advantage that OpenSea still maintains over other competitors in the NFT marketplace sphere, the founders are concentrated on improving customer experience and delivering to customers an even greater sense trust in OpenSea as the go-to marketplace for all of their NFT needs, evetually establishing themselves as the 'Amazon' of the NFT world.

The company also provides their open minting technology which is arguably a more streamlined and user-friendly option than the alternatives. A key optimization which also positions OpenSea favourably against competitors in the space involves an upfront waivor of 'gas fees'(costs of exchanging NFTs or crytocurrencies) during the minting process, such that the cost of minting is debited until the NFT is sold, off-loading the fee onto the purchaser of the NFT and delivering the difference to the seller<sup>[[5](https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-nft-platform-opensea-plans-to-maintain-its-competitive-advantage-ep-232/)]</sup>.

### Current Technologies and their Implementation

OpenSea utilises a large host of technologies to operate their functions, including the following tools and software.<sup>[[16](https://himalayas.app/companies/opensea/tech-stack)]</sup>

> Languages & Frameworks:

* Django
* Next.js
* Materialize
* JavaScript
* Python
* HTML5
* ES6
* CSS 3
* PHP
* GraphQL
* TypeScript
* Solidity

*These languages are used to build the software and digital underpinnings that the OpenSea platform uses for its operations*

> Libraries:

* React
* Moment.js
* Lodash

*The applications listed above under 'Languages & Frameworks' use these libraries to access precompliled subroutines to allow for the software programs that OpenSea uses to function*

> Marketing & Sales Tools:

* Customer.io
* Zendesk
* WordPress

*The company leverages these preexisting marketing and sales APIs (Application Programing interface) and CRMs (Customer Relationship Mnagers) to conduct their marketing and sales related functions*

> Application Utilities:

* Elasticsearch
* Algolia
* FullStory
* Typeform

*OpenSea leverages these search programs and that help search and identify relevant data and trends to assist in the companies research and awareness of the marketplace*<sup>[[17](https://resources.algolia.com/videos/video-whatisalgolia)]</sup><sup>[[18](https://www.elastic.co/)]</sup><sup>[[19](https://www.fullstory.com/)]

> Application Hosting:

* Google Cloud Platform
* Heroku
* NGINX

*As the modern digital landscape bases much of its infrastructure in the cloud, a modern company such as OpenSea is no different, and make use of these cloud server platforms to host and their services and applications*<sup>[[20](https://stackshare.io/stackups/heroku-vs-nginx)]</sup>.

> Collaboration:

* Telegram
* Notion
* Discord

*Collaboration is a key aspect of the development process, and it is important to have a robust framework by which team members may work together to achieve their company's goals. These applications allow for such collaboration*

> Design:

* Font Awesome
* Google Fonts
* Figma

*Design work including font design is handled by these companies which provide databases of licencable designs*

> Analytics:

* Google Analytics
* Amplitude

*Another key component of development, analytics allow a company to appreciate the trends within their marketplace as well as the health of the company, by developing as accurate depiction as practicable of the company's performance and trajectory. This empowers a company to effectively plan and forecast market moves, and make key decision regarding their trajectory*<sup>[[21](https://www.softwareadvice.com/marketing/amplitude-profile/)]

> Data Stores:

* Ethereum
* PostgreSQL

*Companies in the digital landscape find themselves in need of storing data, especially as they grow and the stockpiles of data become quite large. While OpenSea does use Etheruem as a store of data for ownership verification, PostgreSQL is also used as a 'data-warehouse'to store large quantities of information*<sup>[[22](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/what-is-postgresql/)]</sup>

> Assets & Media:

* Cloudflare

*As OpenSea does manage an expensive list of assets, including millions of NFTs, security of its users is paramount, and so a DDoS mitigation company scuh as Cloudflare is used to help mitigate risk by providing improved network performance, security'and reliability'*.<sup>[[21](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/)]</sup><sup>[[22](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/)]</sup>

> Back Office:

* Lever

*OpenSea utilises Lever Co as a 'Talent Aquisition Suite' to assist the company with finding, processing and connecting suitable canditates for employment at OpenSea with hiring officers/the company*<sup>[[23](https://www.lever.co/)]</sup>

* Communications:

* Mailgun

*To assist with sending bulk emails and reviewing analytics surrounding such emails, including the ability to review how emails may appear on other servers, and for a robust email API in general, Mailgun is utilised by OpenSea to meet this function*<sup>[[24](https://www.mailgun.com/)]</sup>

> Development:

* Webpack

*For web development needs, OpenSea uses Webpack to assist in bundling modles that are typically written in JavaScript, such that an internet browser may recieve an aggregated bundle of modules rahter than the seperate modules themselves, improving simplicity and efficiency. It transforms 'modules with dependencies' into 'static assets'*<sup>[[25](https://webpack.js.org/)]</sup>

> Monitoring:

* Sentry

*Web and application development involves the collation and a development of a considerably large amount of code, especially when it comes to a large platform such as OpenSea, and so the company utilises Sentry to assist with monitoring their digital infrastructure. The software allows for error tracking, and the ability to 'fix crashes in real time', thereby improving developer agility and speed in delivering an end product*<sup>[[26](https://developer.bring.com/blog/sentry-usage-in-react-application/)]</sup><sup>[[27](https://sentry.io/welcome/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=9575834322&utm_content=g&utm_term=sentry&device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjvaYBhDlARIsAO8PkE1U7CGJRQuq0dZHT5vWty1v_NG4ngF6W35Nvo3CGfX81rtF7iV1IuQaAuduEALw_wcB&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjvaYBhDlARIsAO8PkE1U7CGJRQuq0dZHT5vWty1v_NG4ngF6W35Nvo3CGfX81rtF7iV1IuQaAuduEALw_wcB)]</sup>

## Landscape

### Domain

OpenSea is in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain within the financial industry, however as time progesses, it would be more appropriate to class it more specifically under the domain of Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs.

### Major Trends and Innovations over the past 10 Years

The overarching blockchain community within which NFTs situate themselves has been in development ever since blockchain 'was (first) introduced in October 2008'.<sup>[[28](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain#:~:text=Blockchain%E2%80%94a%20peer%2Dto%2D,transferring%20ownership%2C%20and%20confirming%20transactions)]</sup> The first ever NFT-like products eneterd the scene in 2012 and were recognised as 'colored coin' which was designed to make use of Bitcoin's blockchain infrastructure to essentially play the role that modern NFTs do today, to be used as 'assets... digital collectibles, coupons, property, company shares, and more'.<sup>[[29](https://blog.portion.io/the-history-of-nfts-how-they-got-started/)]</sup>

Following this inception, between 2014 and 2016, a 'peer-to-peer financial platform with a distributed, open-source internet protocol' that was also built upon the Bitcoin blockchain entered the marketplace, known as Counterparty. The company paved the way for early adopters of the technology to create assets an trade them 'a decentralized exchange, thus providing a way for users to create their own tradable currencies'.<sup>[[29](https://blog.portion.io/the-history-of-nfts-how-they-got-started/)]</sup>

Following this, 2017 can be seen as the year where cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies took-off accross the world, with the NFT space following suite with the advent of Cryptopunks, created by Larva Labs. A novel precedent was established when these new NFTs were created on the ethereum blockchain, which allowed for the ability to track the ownership status of an NFT - a major inovation within the NFT domain; a feat which the Bitcoin blockchain was unable manage.<sup>[[30](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq)]</sup>

Between 2017 and today (2022), the NFT scene has grown immensely, and it is arguable that the timing of OpenSea could not have been more appropriate to contribute towards its success, having likewise been established in 2017. As the NFT scene entered the mainstream, observers of the space gained confidence through social proof. This is exemplified when we look at an event which occured on Valentines day in 2018 when the artist Kevin Abosch sold an NFT for $1M (USD) which proved to be the most expensive NFT sale up to that point in time.<sup>[[31](https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/14/technology/crypto-art-valentines-day/index.html)] This record has since been broken in a major may from the artist Beeple's sale of 'Everydays: The First 5000 Days' on March 12th 2021 for roughly $69M (USD).<sup>[[32](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924)]</sup>

Currently, in terms of innovative technologies that the NFT domain is utilising, the following list of definitions pulled from blog.portion.io sums up the standards by which both fungible and non-gungible tokens are generated on the ethereum network:

* **ERC-20:** *fingible* tokens built on Ethereum. Each token is *indistinct* from another of its kind in terms of value and characteristics. Think of it like a $1 bill. *Examples included DAI, USDC, Tether*'

* **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs):** built on Ethereum, except they are non-fungible, i.e. each token is *unique, distinguishable, indivisible, and one of a kind.*
Most NFTs are created using 1 of the 2 token standards - ERC-721 and ERC-115 ((need to underline))

* **ERC-721:** standard protocol for issuing **NFTs.** Represents a single unique asset that cannot be interchanged or divided. Think of it like an original painting or diamond - no two are the same. *Examples include CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks, a 1/1 NFT*

* **ERC-1155:** lets you mint multiple assets in a single smart contract. Think of it like creating a basket of tokens. *Examples include a piece of art with 20 multiples/editions*<sup>[[29](https://blog.portion.io/the-history-of-nfts-how-they-got-started/)]</sup>

Again, these standards are a major innovation within the NFT space as they allow for greater functionality when users utilise the Etheruem network. The Ethereum network itself has therefore been a major contributor to the success of NFTs by providing the blockchain backbone upon which these advancements and utilisations are made possible.

### Competitors in the Domain of NFT Marketplaces

There are several competitors in the NFT space who look towards seizing the crown from OpenSea, and many have promising technologies.

> **Mintable**

One such competitor is Mintable which places a greater focus on the creators of NFT products rather than the broader standpoint that OpenSea is rooted in - focusing on the NFT community as a whole. It was launched in 2018 and positions itself as 'a next-generation non-fungible token marketplace' and has strong backing, invloving investment from the renowned Mark Cuban.<sup>[[33](https://mintable.app/)]</sup>

The distinction between focusing on the NFT market as a whole, or just on creators, turns out to be the primary distinguishing factr between OpenSea and Mintable, with the former offering a 'better option or those who want low fees and a wider range of investment options'. ((insider)) On the other hand, Mintable is more favourable for 'creators who prioritize high royalties' as creators are able to set their own desired royalty rate, versus the flat 10% royalty rate offered on OpenSea.<sup>[[34](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/opensea-vs-mintable)]</sup>

> **Rarible**

Another major competitor is Rarible which entered the market in 2020 and has a business model very similar to OpenSea as it also offers a marketplace to both exchange and mint NFTs. The main differenciating factor between the two comes to company governance; Rarible, unlike OpenSea, offers decentralised governance which is a majot innovation in the industry, made possible through decentralised blockchain technology. This is made possible through the marketplace having its own native token called 'RARI'.<sup>[[35](https://rarible.com/)]</sup>

'Holders of RARI can automatically cote on policy changes and other critical decisions', however this functionality was 'discontinued in January 2022 after the community unanimously voted to allocate the remaining RARI tokens to projects building on the Rarible protocol'.<sup>[[36](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/opensea-vs-rarible-which-is-the-better-nft-marketplace/)]</sup>

Rarible also offers greater incentives towards creators when contrasted againsts OpenSea. While it does not provide the ability to set your own royalty rate like Mintable, it does offer royalty fees of up to 50%<sup>[[36](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/opensea-vs-rarible-which-is-the-better-nft-marketplace/)]</sup>

## Results

### Company Impact

OpenSea has proved to have a tremendous impact on the NFT market by positioning itself as the go-to marketplace to mint, buy and sell NFT profucts, being the largest player in the industry. In doing so, the company has also encouraged greater interest into the sector as it shows potential market participants that the infrastructure of the NFT world is robust, mainstream and reputable.

### Core Metrics used to Measure Success & Company's Current Performance

Success in the NFT world, like many domains in finance or otherwise, is generally measured by market capitalisation and market share. Being the current laregest player in the domain of NFT marketplaces, the company is therefore at the peak of the market and obnectively performing very well, and as mentioned previously, OpenSea has a market valuation of $13.3B (USD).<sup>[[2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/06/07/the-future-of-crypto-and-blockchain-fintech-50-2022/?sh=6d905f5360cc)]</sup>

Market share is impressive and substatial at 80% as of February 2018, which again, highlights the company as the 'top dog' in the NFT marketplace space.<sup>[[37](https://forkast.news/state-of-the-nft-market/nft-marketplace-competition-heats-up/)]</sup>

### Performance Relative to Competitors

OpenSea is outperfoming its competitors as it is holding the number one spot in the NFT marketplace in terms of market share, as mentioned prior. Coinbase is a competitior in the parallel domain of cryptocurrency exchanges holds some potential at challenging OpenSea for the top spot in the NFT marketplace domain as they plan to enter the domain in collaboration with Mastercard. However, time will tell whether or not this competitor is successful is securing the position.

### Recommendations

I would suggest that OpenSea develop and provide their own website-based crypto currency wallet that users can then store their digital coins in, rather than using a third wallet to do, which is currently the case.

An internal cryptocurrency wallet would benefit OpenSea as it would allow them to become further vertically integrate, supply them with data regarding their users, and offer a service that further differentiates them from their competitors.

Vertical integration can be helpful in increasing efficiency and keeping everything 'in-house' and under one brand. It also further exemplifies there points of difference as it provides users with another service that competitors aren't currently offering. Storing cryptocurrency in the same area as where you trade NFTs also allows users who are unfamiliar with the world of blockchain to decrease their learning curve as it eliminates the need to set up a wallet with a third party. This could also improve customer retention, espectially when customers are very new to the space and may be unwilling to learn more than what they're comfortable with.

Having an inbuilt wallet also provides OpenSea with extra data points on their users, providing information such as spending habits an can be used to develop trends and further quantify their practices. Analytics are greatly valuable in today's digital world, and increasing data collected would therefore be beneficial to OpenSea.

### Technologies used and Relevance to the Proposed Solution

There are many ways in which OpenSea may choose to design a web-based crypto wallet that is able to synchronise with their NFT marketplace. One such method would be to develop a web-based application using Node.js or Angular.js, as well as HTML5 and CSS3.<sup>[[38](https://imaginovation.net/blog/crypto-wallet-app-development-guide/)]</sup>

These technologies are apporpriate to the solution as the solutions is relatively straight forward. The technology of the cryptocurrencies themselves is more advanced, involving the blockchain and smart contract, however generating a cryptocurrency wallet is much less complex. To develop the software into the website as I've suggested, web application development would be the primary toolkit to utilise, and so standard web development methods would apply.
